# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

Versions `< 1.0` are the legacy Python implementation of `paperpile-notion`, which won't
be supported unless a Notion-support Python SDK is released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is a vulnerability, please [open a new issue on GitHub][new-issue] describing it
and ways to fix it. (As I lack an up-to-date background in security, I imagine guidance
will be necessary to ensure an appropriate fix is made if it's a vulnerability exposed by
`paperpile-notion`.)
